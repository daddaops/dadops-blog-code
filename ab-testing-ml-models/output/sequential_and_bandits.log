A/A test false positive rate (10,000 simulations):
  Naive peeking:   14.0%  (should be 5%!)
  O'Brien-Fleming: 6.2%  (correctly controlled)

==================================================

After 10,000 requests:
  Thompson routed 94.4% traffic to Model B (the winner)
  Cumulative regret -- A/B: 35.0 | Thompson: 3.9
  Regret reduction: 89%
  Thompson routing >90% to B by request 1002
