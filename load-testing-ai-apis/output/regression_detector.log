=== Regression Detection Demo ===

--- Scenario 1: No regression (similar distributions) ---
Baseline mean: 50.3 ms
Candidate mean: 52.9 ms
Change: +5.1%
Welch's t=-3.94, p=0.0002, df=196.4
Cohen's d=0.56
Verdict: PASS

--- Scenario 2: Clear regression (20% increase) ---
Baseline mean: 50.3 ms
Candidate mean: 60.2 ms
Change: +19.7%
Welch's t=-12.15, p=0.0000, df=169.0
Cohen's d=1.72
Verdict: REGRESSION DETECTED

--- Scenario 3: Borderline (significant but small, <10%) ---
Baseline mean: 50.3 ms
Candidate mean: 54.3 ms
Change: +8.0%
Welch's t=-5.99, p=0.0000, df=194.4
Cohen's d=0.85
Verdict: PASS

=== Welch's t-test Verification ===
  Test: a=[1..5], b=[5..9]
  t=-4.0000, p=0.000127, df=8.0
  Expected: t ≈ -4.0, p < 0.01, df ≈ 8.0
  Match: t < 0 and p < 0.01: True

=== Summary ===
  Scenario 1 (no regression): PASS
  Scenario 2 (regression):    DETECTED
  Scenario 3 (borderline):    PASS (below threshold)
