4. Soak Pattern (concurrency=24, 5s):
   t=  0.0s  concurrency=24
   t=  1.0s  concurrency=24
   t=  2.0s  concurrency=24
   t=  3.0s  concurrency=24

5. Composed Test Plan:
   Total steps in plan: 19
   Concurrency range: 1 - 64

=== Burst Pattern Verification ===
   Blog says burst at 70% of each period (last 30% is burst)
   Burst steps: 12/40 (30%)
